Configuration Setttings
=======================

1. Open your images
===================

- The first step is to load your image by dragging and dropping the image on the interface.
- Open the plugin via Plugins > Segment Trunk (Napari Tree Rings).

2. Set configurations
=====================
- If you would like to change the default configurations, click on the âš™ button:
    - Options of Segment Trunk:
        - Scale Factor: controls how much your image is scaled down before processing (default is 8).
        - Opening radius: the size (in pixels) of the structuring element used in the opening operation, which removes small objects and smooths boundaries in the image (default is 96).
    - Options of Segment Rings:
        - Ring model: choose model for segmenting tree ring boundaries
        - Pith model: choose model for segmenting pith
        - Patch size: image will be cropped into smaller patches to ensure computational cost. The default is 256, since it is the size we used to train our models.
        - Overlap: the proportion of length shared between adjacent image tiles to ensure smooth transitions and avoid edge artifacts. The default is 60.
        - Batch size: the number of tiles processed together in a single iteration. The default is 8.
        - Thickness: the thickness of output ring boundaries.
        - Rescale Factor: controls how much your image is scaled down before post-processing (default is 5).
        - Heuristic function (H0, H01, H02): choose the heuristic function applied in the post-processing of A-star algorithm. Default is H0.
